Definition: Mad Libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words. You or another player then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.
+List inputs, process and outputs
Randomly select the sentence from a DB/storage
Assign that sentence to a string(word) array
Randomly choose array index and delete the corresponding word
User give inputs for blank place
Output will be with new sentence with given new word inputs
+Write test cases
	-	hello mehmet what are you …… ha!!
	emptyPlacesInput length> 0 && emptyInput length<10
	emptyPlacesInput = ‘’ ⇒ error
	emptyPlacesInput = ‘hallo’ ⇒	hello mehmet what are you hallo ha!!
	emptyPlacesInput = 5 ⇒ hello mehmet what are you 5 ha!!
+Find constraints
	-	emptyPlacesInput must be between 1- 10;
+Write the algorithm in pseudocode
